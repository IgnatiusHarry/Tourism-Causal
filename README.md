Regional Tourism Dynamics in Indonesia: A Spatial and Fixed Effect Analysis of Economic Performance and Unemployment in 34 Provinces (2018-2020)

**Abstract**

This study investigates the impact of tourism development on Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP) and unemployment rates across 34 provinces in Indonesia from 2018 to 2020. Using the Post-Double Selection (PDS) method for variable selection and fixed effect regression models for analysis, the study finds that foreign tourism significantly enhances GRDP and reduces unemployment, while domestic tourism shows insignificant economic impact due to inadequate infrastructure and fewer attractions. These findings highlight the uneven distribution of tourist benefits and the importance of foreign tourism in provincial economic performance and unemployment reduction. Furthermore, the study offers policy recommendations aimed to reduce unemployment and promote Indonesia’s inclusive economic growth.

**Data**

This study utilizes foreign and domestic tourist numbers as proxies for Indonesian tourism development. This research controls for macroeconomic factors (FDI and DDI), tourism employment, human capital (Human Development Index), infrastructure (number of accommodations), tourist attractions, and population density. Data were sourced from Statistics Indonesia. The construction of the estimation sample uses purposive or non-probability sampling. Purposive sampling involves deliberately selecting specific individuals or groups based on certain criteria that align with the research objective. In this case, the sample of this study is a balanced panel data consisting of all 34 provinces in Indonesia from 2018 to 2020. The detailed provinces are provided in the Appendix. This period was chosen due to the peak influx of tourists before the Covid-19 pandemic. Detailed provinces are in the Appendix, and the statistical analysis of the variables follows.

**Methodology**

This study applies fixed-effects estimation and spatial data analysis to examine the impact of tourism-related factors on Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP) and unemployment rates across Indonesian provinces from 2018 to 2020. The fixed effect regression models control for time-invariant provincial characteristics, allowing for the identification of the specific impact of tourism variables on economic performance and unemployment within each province. Moreover, This study cleaned all data using R software and utilized several package such as such as Dplyr, ggplot, readXL, glmnet. plm, tmap, SF,etc. Moreover this study rovided map analysis for better understanding about Indonesia's Provinces.

**Result**

This study significantly contributes to the existing literature by providing a nuanced, province-level analysis of tourism’s impact on economic performance and unemployment across Indonesia’s 34 provinces from 2018 to 2020. While previous research has often focused on national-level impacts, this study addresses the gap by exploring the local variations and dynamics within each province, thus highlighting the uneven distribution of tourism benefits and their implications for regional economic development. The fixed effect regression analysis indicates that foreign tourism has a statistically significant positive impact on GRDP, highlighting its importance in boosting economic activities. In contrast, domestic tourism does not show a significant effect on GRDP. Additionally, foreign tourism is found to significantly reduce unemployment rates, while domestic tourism does not have a notable impact on employment levels. Thus, the findings suggest that policymakers should focus on attracting more international tourists and improving infrastructure to maximize the economic benefits of tourism. By addressing the disparities in tourism benefits across provinces, Indonesia can foster more balanced regional economic development and leverage tourism as a strategic tool for economic growth and job creation.
